## Project Overview
This project is the analysis of customer complaint data collected from January 1 to February 19, 2024, to identify key areas for operational improvement useing tools such as a check sheet, Pareto chart, run chart, and cause-and-effect diagram to analyze the data.

## Key Findings
**1. Check Sheet**
The sheet categorizes and quantifies complaints, which are organized into twelve distinct categories.
**Significance:** The data showed that 'Unprofessional Staff' is the most significant category, with 24 complaints, followed by 'Item/Property Damaged,' highlighting key areas for operational focus.

**2. Pareto Chart**
The chart categorizes complaints by frequency and highlights the most common issues.
**Significance:** The chart shows that "Unprofessional Staff" was the most common complaint at 32%, followed by "Item/Property Damaged".

**3. Run Chart**
The three run charts track complaint trends over eight weeks: the first shows overall trends, the second focuses on unprofessional staff complaints, and the third highlights item/property damage complaints.
Significance: **The Overall Complaints** chart shows fluctuations, with Week 4 having the highest and Week 3 the lowest number of complaints. **The Unprofessional Staff Complaints** chart reveals an upward trend, peaking at 5 complaints in Week 8. This indicates an urgent need to address staff conduct and improve training and supervision to enhance customer satisfaction. **The Item/Property Damage ** chart shows variability, peaking in Week 4. This fluctuation indicates operational challenges needing investigation. Ongoing monitoring will help identify root causes and reduce complaints.

**4. Cause-and-Effect Diagram**
The diagram identifies the root causes of the most significant issues highlighted by the Pareto chart. The diagram categorizes potential causes into major areas: people, process, environment, and training.
Significance: By categorizing issues into four key areas, we can systematically identify root causes and prioritize areas for improvement as follows:
- People: The findings highlight significant behavioral concerns among staff, including negative attitudes, unprofessional appearance, alcohol use before or during work, and privacy violations.
- Processes: The diagram identifies critical flaws, such as equipment neglect and incomplete job transitions, which can lead to late arrivals or no-shows that compromise service quality.
- Training: A significant lack of training in customer service and communication skills is a major factor contributing to complaints.
- Environment: Workplace culture and high stress levels are underlying factors contributing to carelessness and lack of motivation.
