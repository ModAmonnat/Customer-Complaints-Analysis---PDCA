## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer complaint data collected from January 1 to February 19, 2024, to identify key areas for operational improvement. Tools used include a check sheet, Pareto chart, run chart, and cause-and-effect diagram.

## Key Findings
**1. Check Sheet:**
The sheet categorizes and quantifies complaints, which are organized into twelve distinct categories.
**Significance:** The data showed that 'Unprofessional Staff' is the most significant category, with 24 complaints, followed by 'Item/Property Damaged,' highlighting key areas for operational focus.

**2. Pareto Chart:**
The chart categorizes complaints by frequency and highlights the most common issues.
**Significance:** The chart shows that "Unprofessional Staff" was the most common complaint at 32%, followed by "Item/Property Damaged".

**3. Run Chart:**
The three run charts track complaint trends over eight weeks: the first shows overall trends, the second focuses on unprofessional staff complaints, and the third highlights item/property damage complaints.
Significance: **The Overall Complaints** chart shows fluctuations, with Week 4 having the highest and Week 3 the lowest number of complaints. **The Unprofessional Staff Complaints** chart reveals an upward trend, peaking at 5 complaints in Week 8. This indicates an urgent need to address staff conduct and improve training and supervision to enhance customer satisfaction. **The Item/Property Damage ** chart shows variability, peaking in Week 4. This fluctuation indicates operational challenges needing investigation. Ongoing monitoring will help identify root causes and reduce complaints.

**4. Cause-and-Effect Diagram:**
The diagram identifies the root causes of the most significant issues highlighted by the Pareto chart. The diagram categorizes potential causes into major areas: people, process, environment, and training.
Significance: By categorizing issues into four key areas, we can systematically identify root causes and prioritize areas for improvement as follows:
- People: The findings highlight significant behavioral concerns among staff, including negative attitudes, unprofessional appearance, alcohol use before or during work, and privacy violations.
- Processes: The diagram identifies critical flaws, such as equipment neglect and incomplete job transitions, which can lead to late arrivals or no-shows that compromise service quality.
- Training: A significant lack of training in customer service and communication skills is a major factor contributing to complaints.
- Environment: Workplace culture and high stress levels are underlying factors contributing to carelessness and lack of motivation.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis using these tools, I recommend the following actions and measurement to improve our moving operations:
1. Enhance Staff Training: Implement training on customer service, communication, professional appearance, and personal hygiene to foster a positive customer experience.
2. Improve Scheduling: Refine scheduling to ensure timely arrivals and enhance efficiency.
3. Regular Equipment Maintenance: Establish routine checks for equipment to ensure operational efficiency and minimize the risk of equipment failure.
4. Cultivate a Positive Workplace Culture: Promote accountability and provide Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) to support employees' mental health in facing personal or work-related issues.
5. Implement a Feedback System: Create a structured feedback mechanism.
6. Establish an Alcohol Use Policy: Define acceptable behavior regarding alcohol consumption at work.

## Corporate Level Measurements
1. **Training Completion Rate:** Track the percentage of employees completing training within 3 months using management software. Aim for 90% completion.
2. **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT):** Conduct quarterly surveys to gather customer feedback, targeting an average score of 85% or higher.
3. **On-Time Arrival Rate:** Monitor the percentage of jobs completed on time via job tracking software, aiming for at least 95%.
4. **Job Completion Rate:** Assess the proportion of completed jobs versus those assigned, targeting a completion rate of 98%.
5. **Employee Satisfaction Survey:** Conduct annual surveys to gauge employee morale, aiming for an average score of 4.0 out of 5.
6. **Turnover Rate:** Calculate annual turnover by dividing the number of exits by the average workforce, aiming for less than 10%.

## Crew Level Measurements
1. **Equipment Downtime:** Track downtime as a percentage of operational hours, with a target of 5%.
2. **Maintenance Compliance Rate:** Monitoring compliance with scheduled maintenance tasks, aiming for 100% completion.
3. **Feedback Response Rate:** Measure the percentage of customer feedback responded within 24 hours, targeting a 95% response rate.
4. **Complaint Resolution Rate:** Assess the rate of complaints resolved within 48 hours, aiming for a resolution rate of 90%.
5. **Compliance Rate for Alcohol Use Policy:** Review adherence to the alcohol policy with random checks, aiming for 100% compliance.
6. **Incident Reports:** Track alcohol-related incident reports, aiming for zero incidents over the year.
